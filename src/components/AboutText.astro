<h2 class="font-bold text-xl">About</h2>
<p>
    Hi! I'm Michèle, also known online as ArcticAxi (or just Axi). 
</p>
<p>
    I'm a CS student who loves building websites 💻, games 🎮, and other bits of software. This site is made with Astro and TailwindCSS, but I also work with other languages (and always learning more! 🌱). 
</p>
<p>
    I'm passionate about crafting clean, functional software that looks good and <i>does</i> good. 
</p>
<p>
    Outside of code, I’m into calisthenics 💪, cycling 🚲, and drawing 🎨 — or whatever creative thing grabs my attention next.
