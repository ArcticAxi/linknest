*A personal, minimalist Linktree-style link hub built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.*

This project serves as a centralized place to showcase my key links — including GitHub, LinkedIn, my poetry website, and other web development projects — in a clean, responsive, and accessible design. It’s lightweight and easy to customize, perfect for personal portfolios or anyone wanting a simple link landing page.

## Features
- Built with Astro for fast, optimized performance
- Styled using Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- Customizable social icons and link buttons
- Dark mode design by default
- Easy to extend with additional links or sections

Feel free to fork, customize, and use it for your own link hub!
