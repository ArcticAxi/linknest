# Axi's Linknest

*A personal, minimalist Linktree-style link hub built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.*

This project serves as a centralized place to showcase my key links — including GitHub, LinkedIn, my poetry website, and other web development projects — in a clean, responsive, and accessible design. It’s lightweight and easy to customize, perfect for personal portfolios or anyone wanting a simple link landing page.
